# Tech Blog

## Description
The Tech Blog is a user-friendly CMS for visitors interested in writing their thoughts, sharing their blogs with the world, and interacting with other writers on the platform. The Tech Blog allows you to write, post, read, and comment on blogs, while displaying the user created and created date. 

## Usage

Visitors can sign up to begin posting on their blog. Anyone can read the posts, but you must have an account to write your own or comment on other users' blogs. To post, navigate to the dashboard. From there, you will be able to view your past posts, as well as create a new one.

To leave a comment on another user's post, simply add a comment underneath the blog. Other users' comments will be available for you to see as well.
